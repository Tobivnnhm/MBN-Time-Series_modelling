# MBN-Time-Series_modelling
#
# R scripts for modelling time series of the MarinBasis Nuuk (Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program)
# The models use regularized and deseasonalized data og the main phytoplankton groups and their
# physicochemical drivers. The data are tested for trends, temporal autocorrelation before multivariate
# state space modelling
